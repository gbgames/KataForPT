This project is my implementation of the Vending Machine Kata, based on https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-vending-machine

To follow along with my approach, feel free to step through the changesets and read through my updates to Thinking.txt.

To build this project, you'll need CMake and a C++ compiler (I used g++) installed. From the source directory:

mkdir bin
cmake ..
make 

TODO: 
I did not finish implementing the kata. Still left are the stories for Sold Out and Exact Change Only.
